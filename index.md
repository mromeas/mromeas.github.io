I am a cryptography expert at [ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr), the French cybersecurity agency.

Before that, I was a PhD student in the GRACE team at Ecole Polytechnique and INRIA Saclay under the supervision of [Françoise Levy-dit-Vehel](http://www.levy-dit-vehel.net/).

My main research interests are:
 - Post-quantum cryptography, with a particular focus on isogeny-, code- and lattice-based cryptography as well as hybridization.
 - Developing security notions and models that match the security expectations of real-world cryptographic applications.
 - Developing advanced primitives for the outsourced storage setting (e.g. cloud computing) such as Updatable Encryption and Proofs of Retrievability.
 - Understanding the mathematical foundations of asymmetric cryptography.

I organize a Cryptography Seminar at ANSSI.

I also make challenges for the [French Cybersecurity Challenge](https://fcsc.fr/en/), a yearly Capture The Flag competition organized by ANSSI. You can replay all of them and others on [Hackropole](https://hackropole.fr/en/).
